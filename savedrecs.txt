AB With the progress of human society, more and more scientific and technological achievements are applied to people's development activities, and virtual reality technology is one of them.)is case is a study on the path, form, and role of virtual reality and augmented reality technology in public art design.)rough combining the public art form and current situation, we put forward the problem of increasing public art creation methods through the intervention of virtual reality technology, change the display method of public art with innovative technical solutions, and explore innovative ways of public art design application. In the research process, the author carried out detailed case research, technical demonstration, and creative practice on virtual reality technology; combined and studied a lot of advanced technical means that can be applied in public art creation and display design; and explored the collaborative innovation of technology and art, the public art design methods, and application approaches in China. On the basis of a comprehensive understanding of the artistic effects that can be achieved by related software and the future directions studied by technical personnel, analyzing the demand and feasibility of the technology in the application of public art, and exploring and summarizing virtual reality technology and augmented reality technology under the background of rapid development and popularization, public art design uses these technologies to solve practical problems and promotes the process of art design innovation and publicization by means of innovative media and experience forms. It increases the importance of virtual technology in public art and changes the traditional business model of public art. Experimental results show that the public's attention to public equipment based on sensors and virtual reality technology has increased by more than 60%, and modern technology is used to make up for the development of public art and culture. The digital sustainable development of interactive installations of public art in my country provides new ideas.

AB Characteristics of children's paintings have been suggested considered for application in public art since they are known to positively evoke a sense of well-being when people see them. This study aims to understand the impact of artistic features from children's drawings on people's well-being; then analyzing the adaptive design principles of 3D public art featuring children's paintings on people's happiness; and finally, exploring the influence of 3D public art featuring children's paintings on improving public spaces and enhancing people's well-being. The results lead to proposing a conceptual framework for public artworks in public spaces for improving people's happiness. The proposed conceptual framework recommends that, by applying the visual and thinking features of children's paintings to public art, artists can design high-quality artworks suitable for a city, which could improve people's happiness in public spaces. This study recommends further research into how public art can promote public spaces and shape the urban culture. It contributes to enhancing the quality of public art and public spaces, and inspiring a sense of well-being among citizens through the use of appropriate public art. The results are significant because they will help artists to create more high-quality public artworks for urban public spaces in order to evoke people's happiness.

AB With the maturation and widespread adoption of digital technology, the integration of digital art into public spaces has emerged as a novel artistic design approach to enhance urban image. However, in the design and creation process, artists or designers often dominate, leading to a discrepancy between the artwork and the preferences or perceptions of the actual participants in public spaces, ultimately resulting in failure to achieve the desired outcomes. To design digital art installations in public spaces that attract user participation and interaction, it is essential to explore the mechanisms through which digital art influences public space design.To this end, the study first conducts a literature review to analyze the transformations under the mutual influences of digital art, public spaces, and users, thereby clarifying and defining the concepts and characteristics of digital art, public spaces, and users. Through this analysis, 15 design influence factors for digital art interventions in public spaces are identified, including scale, accessibility, and cultural-historical context. Subsequently, structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed to investigate the relationships and relative weights of the influences of public spaces, digital art, and users on users' willingness to participate, as well as the correlations and weights among the 15 influencing factors, such as scale, accessibility, and cultural-historical context. The findings reveal that public spaces, digital art, and users all have positive effects on users' willingness to participate. Furthermore, the 15 influencing factors, including scale, accessibility, and cultural-historical context, not only affect public spaces, digital art, and users but also directly influence users' willingness to participate. This study uncovers the complex interactions among digital art, public spaces, and users, providing theoretical support for the design and implementation of digital art in public spaces.

AB City is a kind of structure and form of institutionalization of materialization, culture and group survival management in the process of human civilization. Public art is the embodiment of the ideal and passion of modern urban culture and urban life, which is a unique way to shape, memorize and enjoy the city and is the symbol of the geographical location and geographical features of the urban cultural spirit. Especially in the field of art, the emergence of digital art has begun to occupy a place in the palace of art, and the public art of the city has also begun to digitize. In terms of digital city public art, interactivity has gradually become an important characteristic. Under the influence of the interactive features of digital city, the subject of this paper is "digital public system of urban art", and systematically studies the theory and method of performance based on digital art of public art, explores the development trend of new creative ways in the future, and provides theoretical reference and guiding practice for the development of urban public art.

AB The preservation of twentieth-century public art is an urgent management problem and of expanding interest for conservation. The National Public Art Council in Sweden has initiated a research project, Management of Public Building-Related Art in Public and Private Ownership. The project is being carried out in collaboration with the Swedish National Heritage Board, the Museum of Public Art, and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. The aim of the research project is to analyse and to estimate the expertise and financial resources needed for the long-term management and preservation of twentieth-century public art commissioned for government buildings, county councils, and municipalities. Another purpose of the project is to discover how national, regional, and local heritage conservation authorities cooperate in order to support the owners of public art financially or with conservation guidance. As case studies, carried out during 2011, 24 works of art were chosen. The findings showed an absence of overview, cooperation, and legal safeguard for public art. The result will help to improve future supervision and facilitate access to different kinds of resources, thus furthering the preservation of an important part of Sweden's cultural heritage.

AB The development of digital media technology has altered the concept of public space, prompting some public spaces to transform themselves into non-material spaces, while the innovation of traditional public art has also been mobilized. The interactions of public art design which is originated from between reality and virtuality lifted the way how humans view things aesthetically. In view of such theory, the ideas and characteristics of digital media technology have been expounded in this paper, the presentation of digital media technology in public art design has been further elaborated. Then, the applications of digital media technology in public art design in China and the US were compared hoping to obtain more revelations, give play to digital media technology, and keep promoting the constant innovation of public art design in China.

AB The traditional public art education model has many drawbacks. After all, this teaching model is the most common teaching model. Most colleges and universities still rely on the traditional teaching mode. This teaching mode is not attractive, boring, and low cost, so the popularity rate is high. The digital interactive design with multimedia courseware as the main body has played a great role in promoting the teaching of public art education in colleges and universities. In this paper, when teachers use multimedia courseware for teaching, because the computer cannot process physical signals, part of the hardware is a converter that converts physical signals such as light and pictures received by the CMOS sensor into digital signals and inputs them to digital signals and analog signals. Through the converter, the two-way transmission of teacher and student information in the teaching process of public art majors from the perspective of diversified public art was realized. At the same time, the information elements of sound, image and text were integrated into the interactive works of public art majors from the perspective of diverse public art, so as to stimulate students' interest in public art learning. Combined with the application of CMOS image sensor technology in diversified public art teaching, a questionnaire survey was conducted to explore the satisfaction of students in public art education and teaching of colleges and universities by CMOS image sensor technology, 50% of the students agreed with the proposal in this article. In this paper, the diversified public art teaching based on CMOS image sensor technology was derived outside the classroom, and the teaching was related to students' life, so as to improve the artistic atmosphere of the campus and truly improve the teaching effect of public art education in colleges and universities.

AB To improve the quality management of urban ecological public art design and the service centered on residents' needs. Our study introduces a new Quality Function Deployment (QFD)decision-making model called Kano-FAHP-QFD, which applies to urban ecological public art design. Specifically, a new QFD framework is proposed, combining the Kano model and Fuzzy AHP (FAHP). This paper well explains the importance of ranking urban residents' needs and the impacts of the new framework in defining the quality management of urban ecological public art design and the satisfaction of urban residents, while using the framework as a set of prioritized strategies in urban renewal to guide the design and planning of urban ecological public art. The author combined these three approaches to more accurately capture and address their respective issues and thus better understand the residents' needs for urban ecological public art design. In essence, this study investigates how urban ecological public art can be designed and planned in urban renewal through a novel QFD algorithm for urban ecological public art design, with application case validation. Thus, the method keeps the satisfaction of urban residents in line with the positioning and strategies of urban ecological public art design, which is dedicated to enhancing urban vitality, promoting urban renaissance, and sustainable development. It also provides new research ideas for the development of urban ecological public art design in the future.

AB Public art planning and design in the context of smart cities need to keep pace with the times, but the integrity of the original scene needs to be maintained in the process of public art design. Therefore, this paper combines the elements of the scene and integrates the Internet of Things smart city to conduct public art planning and design research. Moreover, based on the multimedia Internet of Things environment, this paper analyzes the effects of virtual reality technology in urban public art planning and design and gives the overall optimization ideas for the organization and rendering of VR scene data. Then, this paper studies the organization and rendering optimization methods of the terrain scene model and the scene model, respectively. The experimental research results show that the smart city public art planning and design system under the multimedia Internet of Things environment designed in this paper has a good smart city public art planning and design effect.

DT Article
AB In order to give full play to the carrier role of modern public art design and inherit the traditional elements whose vitality is gradually losing, this paper analyzes the modern public art design integrating the traditional elements under the interactive technology. Firstly, it analyzes the origin of modern public art design, which is manifested in the rational product of science and technology and the materialized form of cultural aesthetics. Then, it analyzes the current development situation of blindly seeking internationalization, over-reliance on modern tools, and insufficient design education level, and discusses the classification of modern public art integrating traditional elements and the inheritance problems it faces; under the interactive technology, the traditional elements and features are transmitted imperceptibly through a variety of carrier forms to realize the modern public art design integrating the traditional elements. The experimental results show that the resource utilization and benefit of modern public art are increasing exponentially year by year. With the increase of government investment in modern public art design activities, the complete contour map can be obtained by extracting the marked points.

AB Research question: What is the current availability of treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART) in the public sector in Africa, and what are the facilitators and barriers towards its provision?
   Design: Cross-sectional quantitative and qualitative data were collected in two phases from February 2020 to October 2021. Key informants were identified from countries known to provide ART in Africa based on data from the African Network and Registry for Assisted Reproductive Technology and the 2019 Surveillance from the International Federation of Fertility Societies. Quantitative data were collected via a structured questionnaire (Phase 1); public centre-specific quantitative and qualitative data were then collected via a semi-structured questionnaire followed by a virtual interview (Phase 2). Data were analysed descriptively.
   Results: Informants from 18 countries reported the existence of 185 ART centres in 16 countries. Twenty-four centres (13.0%) in 10 of 16 countries (62.5%) were public. The majority of public centres (20/22 [90.9%]) reporting on ART performed <500 ART cycles per annum. Although public institutions covered most of the cost for ART, copayments from patients were universally required. The number of ART cycles per annum was inversely correlated to the copayment. Lack of policy and legislation, high costs and bureaucratic obstacles were identified by participants as the leading challenges in the delivery of public service ART.
   Conclusion: Lack of public ART services leads to chronic and profound health inequities. Enablers of public service ART in the region are the same known to support ART services in general, namely policy and legislation, appropriate funding and good health service infrastructure. Addressing these requires the collated efforts of many stakeholders.

AB Creating a good public health environment can improve the public's environmental health literacy level. Therefore, we propose a street art image retrieval system to address the problems of artists' single creation method and the exhaustion of creative inspiration in the process of creating street art images in a public health environment. The system can retrieve the relevant image categories and cultural backgrounds, according to the street art images to be drawn, which reduces the artists' creation burden and helps the public to better appreciate and understand art. In the image classification module, a ResNet34 street art image classification network with a nonlocal attention mechanism is proposed by combining the characteristics of street art images. The experimental results show that the method can achieve accurate classification of art images and can accurately retrieve relevant images based on the input art images, helping artists to better create and improve the public health environment.

AB This paper investigates the meanings of urban public space, both as a didactic platform and as a way to spread awareness of climate change through art. What are the roles of public space? How do artworks intervene in urban public space? How can public art contribute to "sustainability" issues? I have argued that the intervention of art in urban public space offers effective ways of developing climate change art, which is understood to be an educator. Public space can be categorized into three different types: everyday, social, and symbolic spaces. These can be used as a platform for opening discussion and learning about the increased issues of the global crisis in contemporary society. I have drawn upon the representative case studies about climate change to explore how they intervene in urban public space and how they engage viewers to spread awareness, which is one of the fundamental aspects of this paper. It also stimulates viewers' perceptions and awareness of a more sustainable future through phenomenological and emotional experiences. Thus, this paper contributes to the understanding and knowledge of the relationship between art and public space with respect to raising awareness about climate change and considering how art intervenes in urban public space to create an eco-didactic platform.

AB Application of multisensor digital fusion technology in public art design in complex environments is deliberated to make public art design develop better. First, the more advanced sensor fusion technology is introduced into public art design, and the basic principle and system composition of multisensor fusion technology are analysed. The application of multisensor fusion technology in the field of public art is deeply analysed from multiple angles. Second, the visibility algorithm in public art design based on a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is studied, and the corresponding model is proposed. Finally, the proposed model is tested. The test results show that the root mean squared error of the model is 0.0261, the network has a good fitting effect on the output value, the similarity between the model output value and the real value is high, the fitting effect is good, the model is accurate and effective, and the identification accuracy is achieved. Moreover, the corresponding example model is proposed. The visibility development level of public art design in a region in the next 14 years is predicted. The algorithm proposed provides some ideas for the application of multisensor digital fusion technology in public art design.

AB This study explores the role of virtual immersive public art in improving the psychological well-being of urban residents. The research is set in the context of urban environments, where virtual immersive public art has the potential to foster innovation, integrate technology, and organically blend into public spaces. The study evaluates the impact of such art on psychological restoration by focusing on three key dimensions: interactive themes, interactive mechanisms, and artistic characteristics. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect participants' real-life experiences and reactions to these art installations. The results show that virtual immersive public art significantly contributes to the restorative experience of urban residents, offering valuable insights into how these installations can promote mental health. Based on the findings, the study provides practical design recommendations for incorporating virtual immersive public art into future urban planning and design projects to enhance urban living conditions and support psychological recovery.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to obtain public survey reactions to concept art for an exhibit about menopausal hot flashes designed to stimulate learning, dispel myths, spur dialogue, and increase empathy.
   Methods: Immediately before viewing the art, participants provided demographic information and answered one open-ended question Immediately after viewing the art, participants answered the same open-ended question, one additional open-ended question, and completed quantitative survey questions.
   Results: Overall, public reactions to the concept art were positive. Qualitative and quantitative data indicated that the public thought the exhibit was appealing, stimulated learning, dispelled myths, spurred desire to have conversations about hot flashes, and increased empathy for women with menopausal hot flashes.
   Conclusions: The exhibit concept art was appealing and was reported to have a positive impact on the public. Study findings provide support for building the exhibit full-scale as a traveling educational resource that might change public discourse around menopausal hot flashes.

AB Scholars have long debated how effective public participation is in urban planning. While most research was designed to assess the effect of public participation, the knowledge gap concerns whether urban planning would receive negative reception without public participation due to failure in managing people's emotions. One of the underlying reasons is that public participation is crucial to public emotion management. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a case of public planning, and more specifically, the effects on public art reception when the planning project is developed by elites, without the involvement and participation of residents. Public art planning involves substantial symbolic and emotional components, and therefore constitutes a suitable case study. This research examines urban sculpture planning in Shanghai. The primary research method is a questionnaire survey, completed by 244 respondents. We argue that public participation is not the sole determinant of public art reception; other factors, particularly locality, also matter: an authoritarian-style urban sculpture planning creates a unanimous reverence and appreciation for flagship art projects on prominent public venues in central cities. However, people's feelings towards sculptures vary in neighborhoods; people are more likely to resist imposed artworks in the environment of their everyday life. Finally, we conclude that a lack of public participation does not always result in a negative reception to cultural projects on the part of the public; however, this lack of public participation is, nevertheless, culturally unsustainable.

AB This study examines the mechanisms through which ecological public art influences pro-environmental behavior, addressing the urgent challenges of the global ecological crisis and sustainable urban development. Using the 5th Shanghai Urban Space Art Season (SUSAS) as a case study, a serial multiple mediation model was established, with ecological public art perception as the independent variable, environmental psychological ownership and ecological awareness as mediators, and pro-environmental behavior as the dependent variable. Based on 326 valid responses, structural equation modeling (SEM), which integrates confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis, demonstrates that ecological public art perception significantly enhances pro-environmental behavior. Environmental psychological ownership and ecological awareness function not only as independent mediators but also jointly constitute a serial mediation pathway. The findings reveal a multidimensional process whereby ecological public art enhances pro-environmental behavior through "perceptual activation-emotional identification-cognitive enhancement-behavioral transformation". Building on these insights, the study proposes intervention strategies focusing on multi-sensory integration, emotional narrative, digital technology application, and community-based practices to reinforce the role of ecological public art in urban environmental governance and sustainable development. Overall, this research advances the theoretical understanding of the social functions of public art and offers a valuable perspective for fostering ecological awareness and action.

DE Urban culture; public space art; urban image; public art system
AB China's marine cultural industry is the key for the economic growth of coastal cities. The development of urban culture is synchronized with marine culture, and urban culture of coastal cities is more or less mixed, with some marine cultural elements. This study attempts to explore the overall design of public space art in coastal cities from the perspective of marine culture look deeply into the relationship between the artistic design of urban public space and marine culture and urban image building. The research results show that both the urban culture and marine culture have the characteristics of agglomeration, diversity, regionality, and radiation; the design of public art is an important factor in the design of urban image, and the design concepts of public space sculptures in coastal cities are closely related to marine culture; the public art system is a system with a sequence and hierarchical relationship; the design of art forms not only depends on their own artistic value but also echoes the surrounding cultural ideas. This study provides a theoretical basis for the rapid integration of marine and urban cultures.

TI A Novel Psychotherapy Effect Detector of Public Art Based on ResNet and
   EEG Imaging
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background and Objective. In view of the imperfection of the current public art evaluation system and practical utility detection system, this paper designs and invents a psychotherapy effect detector of public art based on ResNet network and EEG imaging. The detector includes sensor signal acquisition unit, signal storage and transmission unit, and human-computer interaction visualization unit. The detector is designed in order to test the psychotherapy effect of public art and quantify the public's evaluation of public art to improve the public art evaluation system. Methods. The EEG emotion dataset seed is used for feature extraction with DE, and the emotion is recognized by ResNet. Adam optimizer is used to classify the extracted DE through ResNet50 model. Each batch is set as 5 groups of data and is trained for 50 rounds, then the model is optimized, and the accuracy rate is 76.47%, which output the probability of good emotion through the model. We put the model optimized by ResNet into the intelligent module and visualize it with numerical value. Results. The detector designed by EEG data and ResNet50 optimization model has high accuracy. The results show that the error between the detector data and the questionnaire interview data is small, the average error is 2.77, and the accuracy is 97%. The closer the subject's emotion before the test is to neutral emotion, the closer the questionnaire result is to the test result of the tester, and the smaller the error is. The difference between the tester data and the survey questionnaire data is 0.2, which is in good agreement and has small error. It can be seen that the detector has high accuracy. Conclusion. Our proposed public art psychotherapy effect detector has good accuracy in detecting users' emotions. It can detect the group psychotherapy effect of public art and can classify and screen a large number of public arts in the city by quantitative methods. It provides support for further summarizing the practical utility of public art and provides a new way for the optimal design and follow-up evaluation of public art design.

AB In 1998, the Lisbon Universal Exhibition-Expo'98-led to an urban regeneration process on Lisbon's waterfront. Following the example of other cities, this event was a pretext for rethinking and replacing a depressed area and for reconnecting it with the Tagus river through the creation of a set of new spaces for common use along the water. It was promoted as a public art program, which can be considered quite innovative in the Portuguese context. In view of this framework, this article aims to debate the relationships between public art and the dynamics of urban regeneration at the end of the 20th century. For that, it will analyse: (1) Expo'98's public art program, comparing its initial assumptions with the final results; and (2) the impact of this program, through the identification of the placement of public art before (1974-1998) and after (1999-2009) the event. Although most of the implemented works did not (intentionally) explore aspects of space integration nor issues of public space appropriation, Expo'98's public art program originated a monumentalisation of Lisbon's eastern riverfront, later extended to other waterfront areas. At the same time, it played an important role in the way of understanding the city and public space that decisively influenced subsequent policies and projects. It is concluded that public art had a significant role in urban processes in the late 20th century, which is quite evident in a discourse of urban art as space qualifier and as a means of economic and social development.

AB With the simulation of public performing arts video communication modes, this study aims to explore the application of image-enhanced electronic learning visualization techniques in this field. Through the introduction of this technology, it aims to improve the effect of e-learning and enhance learners' understanding and perception of public performing arts videos. Through the acquisition and processing of public performing arts videos, the image enhancement technology is used to improve the image clarity and color saturation. Based on the e-learning platform, the enhanced video will be transmitted online, so that learners can watch through electronic devices and carry out corresponding learning operations. Finally, the learning effect of traditional learning and image-based e-learning. The results show that e-learning visualization technology based on image enhancement can significantly improve learners' understanding and feelings of public performing arts videos. Through the enhanced video images, learners can more clearly observe the actors' performance movements, facial expressions and other details, so as to better understand the connotation and communication meaning of the public performing arts.

TI Art in Transportation Multimodal Overview
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent decades interest in incorporating art into transportation facilities has increased. Proponents suggest that art is appropriate for inclusion in many modes of transportation and that transportation facilities serve as an ideal venue for art, allowing the public to appreciate art during daily life, be it during a commute, recreational trip, or community festival. This paper provides an introduction to art and transportation, for public transportation as well as other surface transportation modes, including roadway, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities. A brief history of transportation art and public art is presented, as well as legislation that enables local agencies to leverage federal funds and support the integration of art into transportation projects. Examples of art in transportation for multiple modes are presented that illustrate the wide range of possibilities across the country.

AB The University of Massachusetts Amherst is part of Five-Colleges Inc, a consortium that includes the university and four liberal arts colleges. Consortium faculty from the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at the university and from the colleges are working to bridge liberal arts with public health graduate education.
   We outline four key themes guiding this effort and exemplary curricular tools for innovative community-based and multidisciplinary academic and research programs. The structure of the consortium has created a novel trajectory for student learning and engagement, with important ramifications for pedagogy and professional practice in public health.
   We show how graduate public health education and liberal arts can, and must, work in tandem to transform public health practice in the 21st century.

AB Research question: What was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on assisted reproductive technology (ART) activity in public and private hospitals in France in 2020? Design: All women who underwent oocyte retrieval in 2020 (study group, n = 40,759) or in 2019 (comparison group, n = 52,403) were selected from French national health insurance databases. The weekly ART activity in 2020 was compared with the weekly ART activity in 2019. Results: In 2020, annual ART activity dropped by nearly 30% compared with 2019. Whereas weekly ART activity was at its normal level at the beginning of 2020, it sharply decreased and was almost non-existent during the first French lockdown (March -May 2020) in both public and private hospitals. After the first lockdown, private hospitals returned to their normal activity level within 1 month. In contrast, the activity of public hospitals remained well below normal until the summer break, before peaking at 40% of normal activity compared with an expected level of 57%. During the second French lockdown, ART activity was only slightly affected, principally in public hospitals where ART activity was around 48% compared with an expected level of 57%. Conclusions: In countries where intensive care units are principally in public hospitals, greater disruption in public than in private hospitals may have led to an increase in health inequalities for ART activity, as for other healthcare.

TI The Interaction between Public Environmental Art Sculpture and

SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
LA English
DT Article
AB The interaction with the public and the coordinated change with the environment are more important in public environmental art sculpture. To be more accessible to the public, public environmental art sculptures should be integrated with the environment and interact with the public. Paying close attention to the scale and volume design of sculpture is one of the elements that embody and express the connotation of works, as well as one of the objects that sculpture, as a member of environmental elements, must study and analyze thoroughly. Based on this, this paper investigates the relationship between sculpture and environment in public environmental art through an examination of space environment characteristics, with the goal of creating a public space environment in which public art sculpture, the environment, and people are all in sync. The improved AFSA (artificial fish swarms algorithm) model is used to optimize the landscape ecological pattern. The landscape index can be predicted and analyzed more accurately using a dynamic model of landscape pattern from remote sensing and a geographic information system. Experiments show that this algorithm's prediction accuracy has significantly improved, providing a solid foundation for landscape ecological management and planning.

DT Article; Retracted Publication
AB With the gradual improvement of social and economic levels, cities not only meet people's basic living needs, but also have an artistic expression to a certain extent, and the public pays more attention to the beauty of the external environment. Landscapes in cities are settlement landscapes characterized by man-made landscapes, which are not only a cultural resource but also an ecological environment resource. Murals are also the first works of art of mankind. According to records, murals are the largest number of artworks in China. It is a popular work of art, representing social functions with historical value, aesthetic value, political significance, and educational function. Due to the great influence of the latest technology and emerging technology on urban art concepts, murals are widely used in urban public landscapes in Europe and America. Its grand and strong space coverage, not wasting too much space, and its imperceptible influence on vision make it the main element of urban public art. Therefore, the mural design in the urban public environment can improve China's current urban atmosphere and enhance urban characteristics. Bring the citizens a historical and cultural understanding of the urban environment they live in and enjoy art. According to the interrelationship between the city and the public environment and the human mural art, based on the relevant theoretical knowledge of urban planning and design, urban public art management, and based on the basic characteristics of human mural art, this study combines a large number of domestic and foreign cases, starting from the characteristics of the natural environment and human urban environment. This article studies the relationship between mural design and architectural design concepts and concepts in urban public environment landscape design.

AB With rapid technological advancements and increasing environmental challenges, educational systems face demands for innovative teaching methods. This study integrates Virtual Reality (VR) technology into vocational high school art curricula, examining its impact on public art creation and environmental literacy. Based on the Creative Problem Solving (CPS) model and scaffolding theory, the course includes units on public art, aesthetic composition, and environmental issues. Participants were second-year students from a vocational high school in Taiwan, with 29 in the VR-assisted experimental group and 35 in the control group using traditional teaching methods. Data were collected via pre- and post-tests, teacher evaluations, and self-assessments. Results showed that VR significantly improved students' engagement, exploration, and creation, effectively integrating art and environmental knowledge. The experimental group excelled in spatial expression, showing better understanding and interaction with spatial concepts. The CPS model enhanced problem-solving skills, innovation, teamwork, and feedback. This study confirms that combining VR with the CPS model fosters creativity and problem-solving in art education.

ID SECURITY; THERAPY
AB Music can promote the development of physical and mental health, and its therapeutic utility has begun to receive widespread attention from scholars, who have systematically studied the therapeutic methods, processes, and utility of music with the theme of music therapy, and the topic has been extended from music therapy at the individual level to the public health domain. Therefore, it is worthwhile to further explore how the effectiveness of music as a performing arts activity in the public health domain is evaluated. However, most of the current studies focus on the evaluation of the effects of music on individual physical and mental health, and few involve the evaluation of music performing arts activities in the public health domain, which greatly hinders the potential of music performing arts applications in the public health domain. Therefore, this study proposes a dynamic and comprehensive evaluation scheme based on the cross-chain technology in blockchain and establishes a cross-chain-based information exchange model for the feasibility of information exchange between music performing arts and public health. The research findings can not only provide theoretical guidance for the formulation of public health policies but also provide technical support for the comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of music performing arts activities.

AB Arts and crafts, with their very different styles due to many factors such as times, regions, technologies, and cultures and nationalities, have undergone an extremely long process, and it is only through continuous superimposition, development, and innovation that they have gradually formed the posture of today's arts and crafts. Public mental health education is the main way to promote the psychological health development of the public in colleges and universities at present. And among them, sound personality and good self-awareness is one of the important standards of psychological health of the large public and one of the important tasks of mental health education. As an effective psychological test and treatment method, arts and crafts analysis are an important part of mental health education. It has a certain role in improving the level of self-awareness and promoting the integration of personality. Art and craft analysis has advantages in mental health and educational group counseling that cannot be replaced by other words and activities, so it can be used in mental health education courses. It can be used in teaching self-awareness. In order to combine the development of arts and crafts with the development concept and promotion ideas of public mental health education, this article proposes an analysis of the role of arts and crafts in public mental health education based on artificial intelligence computing to enhance the development of arts and crafts from a new perspective and seek the inheritance and innovation of arts and crafts and public mental health education in the new historical period, and proves the proposed method in the relevant dataset. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated in the relevant dataset.

AB This study examines the prototypes, characteristics, and perspectives of public space in museums whose existential values and concepts have continuously changed based on their historical contexts. Based on an understanding of museum architecture and its cultural and social context in Japan, this research focuses on two national museums that represent Japanese modern and contemporary eras. In particular, this research examines The National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo - designed by Le Corbusier, an internationally known French architect, in the 20th century - and the public space of The National Art Centre - the fifth national museum in Japan which was designed in the environment of Japanese museums by a Japanese representative architect, Kisho Kurokawa. This research concentrates on the public space within museums that reflects the flows and social demands of the era, rather than focusing on the architects' design concepts or architectural analysis. A thorough analysis will be conducted, focusing on the museums' floor plans, sections, images, and diagrams to showcase the characteristics and perspectives of public space in 21st century museums

AB Public art plays a crucial role in influencing the development of the urban space environment by embodying the spiritual outlook and cultural heritage of a city. The research status and development trend of contemporary public art and space environment design are introduced in this article. In this essay, the relationship between public art and the environment of public spaces is examined in terms of type, status quo, and impact. The requirements of the virtual process are then thoroughly examined through the practical application of various collaborative software based on the actual needs of 3D virtual reconstruction. In parallel, a genetic algorithm-based optimization design scheme for the space environment is proposed. Numerous experiments are conducted to confirm the viability of this method. The efficiency of this algorithm, according to experiments, is very high, reaching 94.87 percent. The scores of the residents are also good as a result of this article's design. This demonstrates the validity of this approach. The study of public art and urban space environment design is expected to contribute positively to the growth of the city.

TI Evaluating Teaching Quality in Colleges and Universities of Public Art
   Education Using the AHP Fuzzy Comprehensive Method
SO SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
LA English
DT Article
ID EVALUATION MODEL
AB The effectiveness of classroom teaching has emerged as the determining factor in whether a school will endure as higher education in China develops. Currently, all schools and institutions have established public art education classes that offer art education to students who do not study art. With the establishment of public art education, students of other subjects can learn art, film and television, music, calligraphy, dance, and drama and master basic practical skills that fundamentally improve their aesthetic capacity and qualities that promote the emergence of morality, intelligence, physique, and glamour among college students. However, colleges and universities should assess the teaching abilities of teachers after establishing public art education programs and then improve their own teaching abilities by fully altering the public art education model in accordance with the results of the teaching evaluation quality score. This study establishes a method for evaluating the effectiveness of teaching in public art education courses at colleges and institutions. The fuzzy comprehensive is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The system for evaluating the quality of teaching is established, which builds the teacher's teaching evaluation factor set, decides how much weight each teacher's teaching quality evaluation factor should have, establishes the teaching quality evaluation grade, and decides the comprehensive teaching quality evaluation method. The teaching quality evaluation is finally computed using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation formula and the AHP approach in accordance with the evaluation results provided by five different types of experts. The results indicate that department leaders awarded teachers a 94.11 rating for their ability to teach.

AB Intertwining people and place, Ask the River is a public art and placemaking project reconnecting the Brattleboro, Vermont community to the nearby Connecticut River. Ask the River is guided by the Abenaki understanding that people and place are one: we are the River, the River is us. Three artists and multiple community partners create public art for community-a riverscape of shimmering kinetic sculpture spanning the town's parking garage-and in community, in workshops using the hands-on, accessible and engaging process of cyanotype. The River is inspiration and guide. The purpose of Ask the River is for the Brattleboro community to explore seeing ourselves as a part of, not separate from, the River: to create pathways of reconnection, to enable us to hear its voice.

AB Objective: The public health implications of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) are largely unknown by researchers and policy makers alike. Outcomes need to be considered, not just as clinical issues, but in terms of effect on public health.
   Methods: Using a qualitative key informant process involving interviews with selected professionals and a review of the medical literature, eight general themes of public health issues associated with ART were identified, and are discussed.
   Recommendations: Short and long-term health outcomes of women undergoing ART procedures, and of their offspring, need to be considered, as do the epidemiological risks associated with donated gametes and the effect on health services of multiple and preterm births, both produced in higher rates by ART. A national surveillance system and greater inter-jurisdictional communication are important strategies for addressing these evolving concerns.

AB Collaboration between the arts and health sectors is gaining momentum. Artists are contributing significantly to public health efforts such as vaccine confidence campaigns. Artists and the arts are well positioned to contribute to the social conditions needed to build trust in the health sector. Health professionals, organizations, and institutions should recognize not only the power that can be derived from the insights, artefacts, and expertise of artists and the arts to create the conditions that make trust possible. The health sector must also recognize that, while it can gain much from partnership with artists, artists risk much-namely, the public's trust-when they are in such partnerships. This essay unpacks these claims and considers the care and ethical considerations that must be brought to these partnerships to yield constructive pathways for ethical collaboration as well as for both establishing public trust and continuing to hold the health care profession accountable for becoming more trustworthy.

Through literature review, the theoretical basis and research progress of Internet of Things technology and building heat energy cycle are reviewed. Select representative 3D public art design cases for in-depth analysis, and discuss the application of Internet of Things technology in them. Then the actual effect of the Internet of Things technology in the building heat energy cycle is verified by experimental simulation. Finally, data is collected through field research to evaluate the performance of the technology combination model in the real environment and user feedback. The results show that the application of Internet of Things technology in building heat energy cycle can significantly improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption. In three-dimensional public art design, the integration of Internet of Things technology not only enhances the interactive and ornamental nature of art works, but also enhances their environmental adaptability and sustainability. The results of experimental simulation and field investigation show that the technology combined with the model has a good effect in practical application, and can provide a more comfortable and energy-saving environment for public space. Through the intelligent management of heat energy, it is not only possible to achieve efficient use of energy, but also to promote the deep integration of art and technology to create public art works that are both beautiful and environmentally friendly.

AB This exploration is aimed at improving the efficiency and safety of fully automatic line operation in public space. From the perspective of multisensor fusion technology, the definition, development status, and design principles of public art, as well as the related applications of multisensor fusion technology theory and image fusion theory, are introduced by consulting relevant literature. Then, the scheme of subway platform door gap antipinch detection system based on multisensor fusion and the obstacle detection method of tram in transit are proposed. Finally, through the method of questionnaire, the passengers' cognition of public art in subway space and the concerned components of public art in subway space are analyzed. The results show that the subway space art content loved by passengers is mainly daily life, and the degree of love can reach 28%, followed by local customs, culture, and fashion trends, with a degree of love of 23%. Besides, the problem of obstacle detection of tram in transit is also studied, and a new obstacle detection method combining visual sensor transmission detection and lidar detection is proposed. This method can quickly and accurately identify unsafe factors. Therefore, the research on the visibility of multisensor fusion technology in public art design has great reference significance for the rapid development of transportation industry.

DT Article
AB Background Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) continue to significantly impact marginalized communities, contributing to high morbidity, stigma, and social exclusion. Traditional health education strategies often fail to engage affected populations effectively. This study evaluates the impact of a community public art as an innovative tool for improving knowledge, shifting attitudes, enhancing preventive practices, and reducing stigma related to NTDs in Okwelle Community, Imo State, Nigeria. Methodology/Principal findings A mixed-methods implementation research design was employed, involving 724 participants (362 at pretest and 362 at posttest). Public art installations depicting common NTDs in the study location including, Onchocerciasis, Buruli ulcer, and Lymphatic filariasis, were strategically placed in community spaces. Pretest and posttest surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were conducted to elucidate information about the influence of the public art on knowledge improvement and perception shifting. Quantitative data were analyzed using chi-square tests. Findings revealed a significant increase in NTDs awareness post-intervention (p < 0.05). Identification of disease symptoms improved, misconceptions regarding supernatural causation decreased, and preventive behaviors such as healthcare-seeking and participation in community health programs increased. Stigma reduction was evident, with greater acceptance of affected individuals and increased willingness to interact with them. Notably, 98.3% of participants supported maintaining public art as an educational tool. Conclusions/Significance Public art can be a powerful and culturally relevant medium for enhancing NTDs awareness, promoting behavior change, and reducing stigma in endemic communities. This study highlights its potential for integration into broader public health strategies to improve disease awareness and community participation. Future research should explore the scalability and long-term sustainability of public art interventions in diverse settings.

AB As a new urban model, the 15-min city has gradually become a touchstone with which to measure the future sustainability of cities. With a time-limited planning of urban living circles, urban residents can be allowed to access basic daily needs, such as food, health and education, while walking or cycling, thus reducing motor traffic and carbon dioxide emissions and contributing to the improvement of people's well-being and the environmental climate. Within the temporal and spatial confines of the 15-min living sphere, governmental authorities and community bodies commonly integrate public art installations into public spaces to enrich spatial dynamics, cultivate cultural identities, enhance environmental aesthetics, elevate service quality, and foster communal interactions. This study aims to probe into the impact of public art on encouraging urban pedestrianism within the specific context of the 15-min community living sphere along the Suzhou River in northern Shanghai. Drawing upon Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory, a theoretical framework is constructed to unravel the mechanisms by which public art influences residents' propensity for walking, encompassing the attributes of public art, perceived value, and walking intention. Employing Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the model is analyzed to scrutinize the proposed hypotheses. Through this research, we establish and substantiate a novel and pertinent theoretical perspective for advancing human-centric and sustainable urban regeneration. The findings underscore that integrating public art within the framework of constructing 15-min community living spheres contributes to catalyzing proactive urban pedestrianism by enhancing its value proposition.

ID CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT
AB There is a growing body of evidence indicating the arts have a role to play in promoting good health and preventing and managing illness. WHO has called for governments to take an intersectoral approach, both within and across traditional areas of policy, to realise the potential of the arts for public health. To explore what global progress is being made towards this aim, we present examples of arts and health policy development from diverse government areas: health, arts, local governments, and cross government. These examples, which have been selected from a scoping review of 172 relevant global policy documents, indicate that many health and arts policy makers view the relationship between arts engagement and improved health in quite general terms, although some are investing in more targeted applications of the arts to address specific public health issues. The most promising and concrete commitments are happening when health and arts ministries or agencies work together on policy development.
